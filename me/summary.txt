My name is Abdulsamad Suara, but I prefer to be called Samad. I was born on November 22, 2000, and I am originally from Offa Local Government in Kwara State, Nigeria, though I grew up and currently live in Lagos.

I am a curious, driven, and creative individual with a deep passion for artificial intelligence, scalable web applications, and decentralized web technologies. My career goal is to leverage technology to create impactful solutions, support the needs of communities, and make a lasting contribution to society.

Outside of my professional and academic interests, I have a wide range of hobbies that keep me balanced and inspired. I enjoy football, music, movies, anime, puzzles, art, history, space science, and video games like Call of Duty. I also love dogs and value the companionship and energy they bring.

Food is another source of joy for me — I particularly enjoy jollof rice, fried rice, snail, turkey, goat meat, and lamb. These little pleasures remind me of home and culture while fueling my bigger ambitions.

At the heart of everything I do is a dream to help the needy and travel the world with my family, combining compassion with exploration. I strongly believe that technology, when applied with empathy, can transform lives — and that is the mission I want to pursue in my career.
